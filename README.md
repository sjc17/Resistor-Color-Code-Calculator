My first React app. This is an app that lets you obtain the resistance value from selecting its colour bands, or from finding the colour bands using the resistance value.

To dos:
- Implement div that points to the current band selected
- Automatically select the next band after choosing a colour for the current band
- Fix the code breaking for low resistance values (R < 10 ohms)
